# Tic tac toe

This is a browser 2-player tic tac toe game. Players enter their names before starting a game. A popup announces the winner and gives options to close (to see how the gameboard looks at the end of the game) or to play again. Each new round, the player symbols (and consequently the starting order) swap.

Built using Javascript and HTML/CSS.

###### What I Learned

JS
* Factory functions and the module pattern/IIFE
* Making variables from one module available to another 

HTML/CSS
* Putting `&nbsp;` in divs so that they are displayed even if they are empty
* Using `visibility` CSS property to show or hide elements
